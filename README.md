## Overview

This package streamlines and automates the data update workflow for
Sears, dramatically reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.
Designed for efficiency and clarity, the package pulls data directly
from our internal ticketing system, organizes it, enriches it with
relevant data sources, and outputs fully formatted update filesâ€”all at
the push of a button.

## Key Features

- **Automated Ticket Scraping**

  The tool scrapes relevant data update tickets from our internal ticket
  system, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting or sorting.

- **Structured Spreadsheet Interface**

  Notes from the tickets are parsed and organized into a centralized
  spreadsheet using a set of predefined codes, ensuring consistency and
  readability.

- **Integrated Data Enrichment**

  The spreadsheet pulls in supplementary data from various sources,
  including reports from the plan custodian and our internal databases,
  to ensure comprehensive and accurate updates.

- **One-Click Update Generation**

  With a single command, the package generates all necessary files
  required to update both internal and external databases. This
  includes:  
  - Data files in the correct format  
  - Detailed changelogs  
  - Full operation logs for traceability

- **Smart Update Targeting**

  The package automatically determines whether each update applies to
  the internal database, the external database, or both. It also
  distinguishes whether the update pertains to the member or the
  surviving spouse, ensuring precise routing and formatting of records.
