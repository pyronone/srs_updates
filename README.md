## Streamlined Data Updates with Python

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I first joined, processing day-to-day data updates for the Sears
plan was a painfully manual process.

Every month, we’d comb through tickets in Harmony (the internal ticket
system) one by one, copy-pasting details into a sprawling Excel
‘database’ and manually cross-referencing and updating a separate
‘maintenance file’ — a critical file sent monthly to CIBC Mellon to
update and sync their systems.

The process was so tedious it led to skipped steps and one of my first
tasks when I joined was reconciling incongruent data between the
internal and external databases.

Shortly afterwards, I took ownership of the entire data update process —
and transformed it.

**What began as a handful of scripts evolved into a polished,
production-ready Python package: meticulously organized, fully
documented, and rigorously tested.**

Now, the entire workflow is streamlined in a scalable, maintainable
system: Harmony tickets are scraped automatically and exported into a
spreadsheet for quick review and formatting, the database is updated
quickly and accurately via scripts and macros, and the maintenance files
are generated automatically with only minor revisions needed at the end.

**What once took hours of manual work now runs automatically in minutes
with near-perfect accuracy.**

New features and quality of life improvements are constantly being
added, with rigorous testing and comprehensive documentation.

And the real beauty is that **this solution can easily be adapted for
other plans**.
